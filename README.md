# **Denis Lymer Milestone Project 3**
## **Code Institute - Data Centric Development Module**
### **CRUD app - 'Beer Tracker'**
For my Milestone 3 project I decided to create an app I would find useful myself.
I enjoy craft beer and thought a clean, streamlined app that allowed a user to record and edit relevant details 
about the beers they have tried would be useful. Obviously such apps already exist, I have tried some of them,
but I always found them too over-complicated, especially if you've sampled a few beers in one sitting...
so I settled on developing a very user-friendly app that was easy to use and navigate. 
I was impressed by the Materialize framework used in the Code Institute tutorials from this module,
particularly the responsiveness, so I decided to use it in my own project to gain experience using it.

# **UX**

Ease of use was the main goal of this project. I wanted to keep the CRUD functionality within as few clicks
as possible. I also decided to keep the layout to 3 separate pages - Home/main, Add and Edit,
and make navigation between them as simple and obvious as possible.

### **User Stories**

I wrote the following user stories to keep in mind during development:
* As a user I want to be able to easily record details about beers I am drinking or have drank previously.
* As a user I want a streamlined app experience with no features more than one click away.
* As a user I want to be able to edit or delete previous entries.
* As a user I want to be able to record an entry with the minimal amount of info if I am in a rush.

### **Wire frames**

I again used the Balsamiq desktop app to create my wireframes to use as reference points for the app.
I focused on mobile first design, then tablet and finally desktop layout.

# **Features**

## **Existing Features**

### **General**

* Feature 1: Navbar <details><p>The Logo and links to the 'add beer' and 'home pages' are visible on larger and tablet size screens. 
The links have a hover-over effect applied. They collapse into a hamburger button and switch from right to left of the screen on mobile devices. The nav pops in from the left of the screen when the hamburger is clicked.</p>
<br>
![navbar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48594804/94607282-9ea51880-0293-11eb-9be0-18c8d0530999.png)
<br>
![navbar2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48594804/94608379-4111cb80-0295-11eb-993e-4e7e2914f36e.PNG)
<br>
![navbar3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48594804/94608380-41aa6200-0295-11eb-8f64-f8aea2f91ee6.PNG)

</details>

* Feature 2: Footer <details><p>The footer has an image of glasses containing beer which repeats to fill the screen on larger and tablet sizes. It disappears on mobile screens via CSS media queries. The image is copyright free and sourced from google images.</p>
<br>
![footer1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48594804/94608885-f9d80a80-0295-11eb-9c23-c183084dc0a2.PNG)

</details> 

* Feature 3: Colour scheme / Design <details><p>To kickstart the overall design and layout of the site I used Materialize. It has very nice, professional looking layouts and colours. I picked the colours from the palette viewable on their website and chose beer themed hues like browns, yellows and oranges. i also made use of the Materialize buttons, effects and depth/shading effects</p>
<br>
![colourscheme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48594804/94609319-81257e00-0296-11eb-8e4a-9192cb8599a0.PNG)

</details> 

### **Main page**

* Feature 4: Welcome card <details><p>This is a Materialize card with some depth and shading effects applied. It has a short welcome message and instructions on how to use the app.</p>
<br>
![welcome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48594804/94609993-80411c00-0297-11eb-8334-b49e64ca9364.PNG)

</details> 

* Feature 5: 'Add a beer' button <details><p>This is a Materialize button with a pulse effect, tooltip and icon applied. As this button represents the core and main function of the app, I wanted it to be prominently positioned, to really stand out and to have its function easily identifiable by a user.</p>
<br>
![addbutton](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48594804/94610761-afa45880-0298-11eb-86a5-a9c4fcacaf20.gif)

</details> 

* Feature 6: List of entries <details><p>This is a Materialize list to display each entry as they are added by a user. The list items display the 'Beer' and 'Brewed by' data fields prominently. There is a collapsible body triggered by the arrow button to reveal the rest of the data fields per entry.
<br>These are 'Drank at' - to record the users location. 'On Date', 'Comments', 'Rating' and to acknowledge the times we are currently living in, I thought it would be a cool feature to add a 'Social Distancing Observed?' field signifying if the location the user was drinking in was practising social distancing. I opted for a switch on the 'add' and 'edit' pages which proved quite tricky to code in terms of writing and reading to the database and getting it displayed properly on the app after writing and/or editing but I think it was worth the effort.
<br> There are also 'Edit' and 'Delete' buttons to the left of every entry. These along with the arrow button have Materialize logos and tooltips denoting their functionality.</p>
<br>
![list](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48594804/94612336-e11e2380-029a-11eb-907e-a49cd4139b12.PNG)

</details>

### **Add a Beer page**

* Feature 7: Home/Back button <details><p>This is a Materialize button that will return a user to the main page, I positioned it prominently in case they navigated here by mistake.</p>
<br>
![addbuttonback](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48594804/94620760-087aed80-02a7-11eb-93c8-3743f2a1b678.PNG)

</details>

* Feature 8: Add a beer entry form <details><p>This is a Materialize form with seven fields for data entry. The first field is for the 'Beer Name'. It is a text field with a max character length of 100. I made it mandatory so as to make it impossible for a user to save a completely blank entry. I left the other fields as optional as I figured that in some situations, a user may only want to record minimal data and go back and fill in more later.</p>
<br><p>'Brewery Name' and 'Drank at' are also text fields of max length 100. 'On Date' triggers the Materialize Datepicker which keeps all date entries uniform. 'Comments' is a text area with max length of 300 characters. Rating is a number field with a minimun value of zero and maximum value of 10. There are also increment and decrement arrows on the right of the field.</p>
<br><p>Lastly is the switch for 'Social Distancing Observed'. As I mentioned earlier this was difficut to get right but I am happy with it and I believe it gives the app some current relevancy. At the bottom of the form is the submit button (titled 'Beer Me!') which when clicked, writes the data to the MongoDB Atlas database I set up. It also returns the user to the main page where their entry will be available to view.</p>
<br>
![addform](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48594804/94621087-9a82f600-02a7-11eb-8503-569a87c3191e.PNG)

</details>

### **Edit a beer page**
* Feature 9: Edit a beer entry form <details><p>This page is identical to the Add a beer page in terms of layout and structure. It is accessed by clicking the 'Edit' button beside an entry on the mainpage. Then it pulls the relevant data from the MongoDB Atlas database and displays them in the correct fields. All fields are fully editable and changes are commited to the database by clicking the 'Confirm Edit' button. This also returns the use to the mainpage so they can view their edited entry.</p>
<br>
![edit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48594804/94622716-960c0c80-02aa-11eb-9435-5da24563af50.PNG)

</details>

### **Delete an entry**
* Feature 10: Delete an Entry <details><p>The delete function is available beside every entry on the main page. Once clicked it removes all data related to the entry from the MongoDB Atlas database and removes the entry from view on the app.</p>
<br>
![delete](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48594804/94623138-70333780-02ab-11eb-92da-6d467a173417.png)

</details>

## **Features Left to Implement**

* I would like to add a search page/functionality so a user can browse their entries if their lists get very long.

* It might be useful to add beer style categories for larger lists, so they can be sorted more easily.

* Adding API functionality that connects the user to larger beer databases so they can compare their reviews would be a great feature. At the moment I cannot find a reliable one that does not charge a fee for usage.

# **Database**
I wired my app up to a MongoDB Atlas database. I created 2 collections but ended up using only 1 - Ratings.

</details>

# **Testing**
I conducted extensive manual testing as I was coding this project. I documented the testing in an A4 notepad and have transcribed it here by date for reference.

<details>
<summary>10/9/20</summary>
After setting up my Gitpod workspace, I created app.py and base.html files and pushed to GitHub to ensure changes were committing successfully. No issues.
</details>
<details>
<summary>17/9/20</summary>
I setup a basic Flask app, requirements.txt and Procfile. I was able to successfully run the app with Python via the Terminal.
I then created a Heroku app on the Heroku website and linked it to my GitHub repository. I was able to successfuly view my app in the browser.
</details>
<details>
<summary>18/9/20</summary>
An error in my code prevented my Flask app from running. After careful examination this turned out to be a syntax error in my app.py file which was easily fixed.
</details>
<details>
<summary>22/9/20</summary>
The app is taking shape now and my basic pages are setup. It took some time to get them to connect and write to the MongoDB Atlas database. Again I had some syntax errors that I could fix no problem. Tested successfully writing and editing an entry to the database. No issues.
</details>
<details>
<summary>23/9/20</summary>
Setup all pagelinks and interconnectivity. Thoroughly tested in the browser to ensure all navigation worked as expected. Delete functionality was not clearing all entries from MongoDB Atlas database. There was a problem with my routing that I had to consult the Code Institute tutor support team on. I recoded this successfully and it is now working fine.
<br> Created an env.py file to hide my MongoDB password. Setup GitIgnore file to ensure it does not get pushed to my repository. Also created the key on Heroku in the Config Vars section. Tested once complete and app works as expected on localhost but not on Heroku. Fixed by relinking my Github repository on the Heroku website. env.py file is not being pushed to Git repository.
</details>
<details>
<summary>24/9/20</summary>
<br> Made large amounts of code and style changes today. Ran into some issues with my app/database relationship but was able to resolve without need for tutor support. I regularly checked localhost to ensure expected behaviour and made good use of Chrome Developer Tools to help solve positioning problems. At end of day checked Heroku app and all working as expected.
</details>
<details>
<summary>25/9/20</summary>
<br> Much the same as yesterday, large amount of code and CSS changes today. Any issues were resolved without much problem. Checked all code in validators to ensure I wasn't missing anything. Some stray tags detected which I removed and my Jinga code is showing as an error in the HTML validator but as far as I know this is normal.
</details>
<details>
<summary>26/9/20</summary>
<br> Happy with core code so today thoroughly checked all functionality several times and all links and buttons several times. No issues.
</details>
<details>
<summary>28/9/20</summary>
Bug detected when viewing the app on mobile device running Chrome for Android. The Navbar logo is popping out of the navbar into the body element. Was several hours trying to resolve myself and with Code Institute Tutors. This unfortuantely is unresolved. See 'Known Bugs' section below for further details.
</details>
<details>
<summary>29/9/20</summary>
One final pass of code through validators and thorough testing of all app functionality before submission. No issues apart from known display issue caught yesterday.
</details>

## **Known Bugs**
When testing the app on my own mobile device I encountered a display issue with the logo in the navbar. It is partially popping out into the body element. I tried to resolve this using CSS media queries. If the app is viewed and resized in Chrome Developer Tools it can be observed that the media queries work and the issue is fixed. However despite saving and commitiing the changes to GitHub and Heroku, the issue is still observable on the mobile device.
<br> I was several hours online with the Code Institute tutors trying to resolve this. Four different tutors looked at the issue with me but a resolution was not found. The most likely cause is a bug with Materialize itself when interacting with Chrome. I was told by the tutors to log it as a bug in my documentation and explain it for the assessor.

# **Technologies Used**

## **Materialize** - https://materializecss.com/
Materialize was used as the Framework for the app and I incorporated many of its features, as detailed above. I really enjoyed getting to know it and it was a nice change from Bootstrap which I used for my 2 previous Milestone Projects.

## **HTML5** - https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/
HTML5 was used for the general structuring and positioning on the app.

## **CSS3** - https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html
CSS3 was used to style the website.

## **Python3** - https://www.python.org/
Python was used to run the application.

## **Javascript** - https://www.javascript.com/
Javascript is used in conjunction with the Materialize framework to operate the forms and data entry functionality.

## **JQuery** - https://jquery.com/
JQuery was used to deploy javascript functionality with Materialize.

## **Flask** - https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/
Flask was used to dynamically generate pages, links and other content within the app.

## **MongoDB Atlas** - https://www.mongodb.com/
MongoDB was used as the database to read, write, edit and delete data from the app interface.

## **Pymongo** - https://pypi.org/project/pymongo/
Pymongo was used to handle the interaction between Python and MongoDB.

## **Jinja** - https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/
Jinja was used as a templating language for Python. I really enjoyed learning this and found it incredibly useful.

## **Balsamiq** - https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/
Balsamiq was used to create my wireframes at the start of this project.

## **Heroku** - https://www.heroku.com/
Heroku was used to host the final deployed version of the app.

## **Git, GitPod & GitHub** - https://github.com/
Gitpod was used as the development environment. Git and Github were used for version control. My repository was linked to my Heroku app for synchronised commit pushes.

## **HTML validator** - https://validator.w3.org/ 
This was used to ensure the code on my HTML pages were error free.

## **CSS validator** - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
This was used to ensure my CSS stylesheet was error free.

## **CSS Autoprefixer** - https://autoprefixer.github.io/
This was used to check for webkit styles when attempting to rectify a known bug.

# **Deployment**
 This project was fully developed in [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/). To start off I used the [Code Institute template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) available on [GitHub](https://github.com/). 
 As I was building the project I regularly committed my code to my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/menacethedenis/CI_Milestone_3_Denis_Lymer) by pushing it from my local Git repository via command prompts from the GitPod terminal.
 <br>

 The app is deployed on [Heroku](https://beer-tracker-ci-ms3.herokuapp.com/). This was connected directly to my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/menacethedenis/CI_Milestone_3_Denis_Lymer) to allow synchronised pushes of any commits I made.

## **Heroku Deployment**
Deployment to [Heroku](https://beer-tracker-ci-ms3.herokuapp.com/) from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/menacethedenis/CI_Milestone_3_Denis_Lymer) was completed using the following steps:
1. In the browser, navigate to the [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) and login with username and password.
2. 

## **Local Deployment**


# **Credits**
## **Content**

This app is based heavily on the lessons from the Code Institute Data Centric Development Module. I also referenced several threads on Stack Overflow when I was trying to resolve some issues but I did not use anyone elses code. 

<br>The Code Institute tutors were also very helpful in assisting some bug resolution, particularly the known display bug detailed above.

<br>Before starting this project I had a look at some other students projects that had been posted on the Code Institute Slack channels, to get a feel for what others were doing and to hopefully ensure my idea hadn't already been taken. This was purely research, I did not use any other student's code.

<br>The image used in the footer was sourced via google images and is open-source.

## **Acknowledgements**
I would like to thank the tutors at the Code Institute and my mentor Spencer Barriball for their outstanding support, patience, advice and encouragement.
<br>

Thanks also to the Code Institute student care team for keeping me on track, checking in and always being so understanding, empathetic and helpful.
